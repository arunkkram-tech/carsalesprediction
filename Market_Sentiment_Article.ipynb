      "Shares of Dixon Technologies have been displaying strength over the past few months and hit a new all-time high of Rs 19,148.90 in December 2024, from where the stock started to retrace.On the daily chart, the stock is currently trading around Rs 16,919 and has fallen by nearly 6% in the last 2 weeks.However, the stock has shown a rebound from its recent support level near Rs 15,953. The resistance zone is observed near Rs 17,295.It is trading below its 20-day and 50-day EMAs (Rs 17,391 and Rs 15,869, respectively), indicating short-term weakness, though it remains above its 100-day EMA at Rs 14,417, which hints at the underlying medium-term support.While the longer-term uptrend remains intact, with the stock trading above its 100-day (Rs 15,369) and 200-day (Rs 12,752) moving averages, the recent price action suggests a potential consolidation phase.“Dixon has experienced a decline, slipping below its short-term moving average, the 20 DEMA, which has disrupted its momentum. However, the broader uptrend remains intact. The stock is likely to consolidate within the 15,400-17,300 range, with a decisive breakout determining the next directional move,” said Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking.He said a positive outlook should be maintained as long as the stock holds above the lower boundary of this range. Also read: Macquarie bullish on QSR sector; initiates coverage on 2 stocks“In the event of a breakout, Dixon could potentially retest the 18,400-19,000 zone,” Mishra added.Further, the RSI of the stock stands at 62.83, reflecting bullish momentum but nearing overbought levels. This signals a cautious approach as profit-booking may emerge near resistance.The stock has exhibited a bullish reversal pattern on the daily chart around the Rs 15,900 zone. “This level (Rs 15,900) previously acted as a breakout point in the last quarter, reinforcing its significance. A short-term bullish engulfing pattern has formed at the same level, signalling a positive outlook,” said Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.With this, Dongre advised traders to buy the stock with a stop-loss of Rs 15,500 and target a price of Rs 17,500.On Wednesday, Dixon Technologies shares closed 4% higher at Rs 16,930.30 on the BSE.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

      "The shares of Trent, the fashion and retail arm of the Tata Group, witnessed a decline of 3.7% on Thursday and hit their day's low of Rs 6,152.50 on the BSE after domestic brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities downgraded the stock to ‘sell’ from an earlier ‘add’ rating. The domestic brokerage has also lowered the target price for Trent shares to Rs 5,850 from Rs 6,800.While acknowledging Trent's robust growth narrative, Kotak maintained that this positive outlook is now fully factored into the stock's current market value, suggesting that there is limited upside potential in the stock from its current levels.A key concern highlighted by Kotak is the rapid expansion of Zudio, Trent's value fashion brand. The brokerage believes that Zudio has expanded too aggressively, resulting in an overabundance of stores in select urban pockets. This saturation could potentially lead to cannibalization of sales within existing stores and limit further growth potential.Furthermore, the brokerage firm also expressed disappointment with the pace of store additions for Westside, Trent's premium apparel brand. Similarly, the expansion of Star stores, Trent's large-format retail outlets, has also fallen short of expectations, raising concerns about the company's overall growth strategy.In light of these concerns regarding store expansion and potential market saturation, Kotak has revised its financial projections for Trent. The brokerage firm has cut its revenue estimates for fiscal years 2025-2027 (FY25-27) by 1-2% and its earnings per share (EPS) estimates by a more substantial 9-14%.Also read: RIL posted three consecutive quarters of profit decline. Will Q3 deliver big?“After a period of significant stock price appreciation, investors who have profited from Trent's upward trajectory may consider booking profits,” recommended Kotak in its note.The above view and recommendation from the brokerage firm potentially imply that the stock's current valuation now seems to be stretched and that there may be a risk of a potential correction.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
